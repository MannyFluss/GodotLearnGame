text = "Certainly! Here's a playful color palette for your game that incorporates various tones and works well with a narrator-style text box and UI:

Primary Color: #FFB900 (Vibrant Yellow)
This vibrant yellow color can be used as the primary color for your UI elements, such as buttons, icons, and highlights. It adds a playful and energetic touch to the overall design.

Accent Color: #FF4D6A (Coral Pink)
Use this coral pink shade as an accent color to draw attention to specific elements, such as important notifications or interactive elements. It adds a lively and youthful feel to the interface.

Background Color: #E5E5E5 (Light Gray)
Opt for a light gray background color to provide a neutral and calm base for your game. It allows the other vibrant colors to stand out and ensures that the text remains readable.

Text Color: #292929 (Dark Gray)
Choose a dark gray color for your text to ensure readability against the light gray background. It creates a good contrast and allows the text to be easily legible within the UI.

Secondary Color: #00C8FF (Sky Blue)
Incorporate a sky blue shade as a secondary color to add a refreshing and calming element to the palette. It can be used for less prominent UI elements or as an alternative accent color.

Highlight Color: #FFD700 (Gold)
Introduce a touch of elegance and prestige to your game by using a gold color for highlights. This can be applied to important UI elements or to highlight selected options or text within the game.

Remember to use these colors consistently throughout your game to maintain a cohesive and playful visual identity. Experiment with different combinations and variations to find the perfect balance that suits your game's style."
